# Vue non-SFC Example Repository

I've played around with using vue and typescript and really liked the idea of ditching the .vue files due to lacking/complex tooling and editor support.

> This project has been created with `vue-cli 3` and made the changes mainly in the `tslint.json` and `vue.config.js`
